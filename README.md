# Overview

Here are some search and sort algorithms in Go, Ruby and Javascript. (It is still work in progress)

I'm basically practicing all the things I learnt from articles listed below.
All the credit goes to the authors of those articles.

# How to execute code and run tests

## TS

Execute TS code.

```bash
$ node-ts fileName.ts
```

Run tests.

```bash
$ npm run test
```

## Go

Execute Go code.

```
$ go run fileName.go
```

Run tests.

```bash
$ go test -v
```

## Ruby

Execute Ruby code.

```
$ ruby file-name.rb
```

Run tests.

```bash
$ ruby file_name_test.rb
```
